##### Feature Tasks
- [x] Create a single resource express API that can handle ``GET, POST, and PUT`` requests. 
- [x] Choose your own resource, as long as it's not Note or Person.
- [ ] Use the `http-errors` module to create new errors and associate them with a proper status code.
- [ ] Create an `error-middleware` module to handle errors and _use_ it in your server file.
- [x] Create a `model` module to handle dynamic models and use it in your server file. 
- [x] Create methods for filesystem and memory modules to handle `GET, POST, and PUT` operations.
- [ ] Create a series of acceptance tests to test your `GET, POST, and PUT routes`.
    - [ ] * **hint:** _you'll want to use the `before` and `after` hooks provided by `jest` in order to create a `test item` and delete the `test item` after the test has completed_ 
- [ ] Create a `cors-middleware` module that will allow for public use of your API.
